Dear Company Recruiter,

I am a senior majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I particularly enjoyed courses in computer security, databases, algorithms, and operating systems. Last semester, I was an undergraduate teaching assistant for the computer security course (CS 161) at Berkeley, and I enjoyed deepening my understanding of security and creating course curriculum. I am also president of Coaching Corps at UC Berkeley, which helps underserved youth in the bay area by providing student volunteer coaches. Outside of academics, I also enjoy playing and coaching basketball, dancing, and playing guitar.

Through my years at Berkeley and my four previous internships at Northrop Grumman, I have gained valuable experience that I am excited to demonstrate elsewhere. At Northrop Grumman, I have developed a number of tools aimed at increasing efficiency of other Northrop Grumman employees. For example, this summer I wrote a tool in Python and Visual Basic that provides predictions for important channel parameters like carrier to noise ratio and gain over temperature based on unit data, information in specification, and previous performance. Additionally, I rewrote some code that improved the modularity of encryption of data coming down from the spacecraft, which allowed for simpler decryption code, as well. As a teaching assistant, I was in charge of the second project, for which I rewrote in Go the staff solution and autograder alongside the professor. The improved autograder sped up the grading process exponentially.

I would love an opportunity to continue my growth a company with innovative ideas and a successful product I can work on. If you would like to set up an interview or send me a coding challenge, I would be excited to get to know your company better and for you to get to know me, as well!

Thanks,
Paul Legler
