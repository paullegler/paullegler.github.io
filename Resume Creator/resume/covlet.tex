\begin{cvletter}
I am a senior majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I particularly enjoyed courses in computer security and databases. This semester, I am an undergraduate teaching assistant for the computer security course (CS 161) at Berkeley, and I am enjoying deepening my understanding of security and creating course curriculum. I am also president of Coaching Corps at UC Berkeley, which helps underserved youth in the bay area by providing student volunteer coaches. Outside of academics, I also enjoy playing and coaching basketball, dancing, and playing guitar.

Snap is a forward thinking company that constantly innovates. Snap is one of the best uses of smartphones, as it connects people instantly through the use of the camera. Additionally, Snap must have a focus on the security of their user data and ensure that communication is secure between users, two concepts I would enjoy working with. I would enjoy the opportunity to contribute to impressive projects and grow as an engineer at Snap.

Through my years at Berkeley and my four previous internships at Northrop Grumman, I have gained valuable experience that I am excited to demonstrate elsewhere. At Northrop Grumman, I have developed a number of tools aimed at increasing efficiency of other Northrop Grumman employees. For example, this summer I wrote a tool in Python and Visual Basic that provides predictions for important channel parameters like $\frac{\text{Carrier}}{\text{Noise}}$ ratio and $\frac{\text{Gain}}{\text{Temperature}}$ based on unit data, information in specification, and previous performance. Additionally, I rewrote some code that improved the modularity of encryption of data coming down from the spacecraft, which allowed for simpler decryption code, as well.
