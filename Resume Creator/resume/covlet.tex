\begin{cvletter}
I am a senior majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I particularly enjoyed courses in computer security and databases. Last semester, I was an undergraduate teaching assistant for the computer security course (CS 161) at Berkeley, and I enjoyed deepening my understanding of security and creating course curriculum. I am also president of Coaching Corps at UC Berkeley, which helps underserved youth in the bay area by providing student volunteer coaches. Outside of academics, I also enjoy playing and coaching basketball, dancing, and playing guitar.

Through my years at Berkeley and my four previous internships at Northrop Grumman, I have gained valuable experience that I am excited to demonstrate elsewhere. At Northrop Grumman, I have developed a number of tools aimed at increasing efficiency of other Northrop Grumman employees. For example, this summer I wrote a tool in Python and Visual Basic that provides predictions for important channel parameters like $\frac{\text{Carrier}}{\text{Noise}}$ ratio and $\frac{\text{Gain}}{\text{Temperature}}$ based on unit data, information in specification, and previous performance. Additionally, I rewrote some code that improved the modularity of encryption of data coming down from the spacecraft, which allowed for simpler decryption code, as well. As a teaching assistant, I was in charge of the second project, for which I rewrote in Go the staff solution and autograder alongside the professor. The improved autograder sped up the grading process exponentially.

I would love an opportunity to continue my growth a company with innovative ideas and a successful product I can work on. If you would like to set up an interview or send me a coding challenge, I would be excited to get to know your company better and for you to get to know me, as well!
